_The [original contract code](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe6a2c1642455ce65d07abb417a461c6e1bed47a1#code) has been changed to simplify deployment._


## Vulnerability
The vulnerability lies in the code below. 
**It allows anyone to move anyone else's funds to an address that is trusted.** 
It is understood that the trusted address can be a popular DeFi smart contract such as Uniswap Router. 
_The attacker will not be able to take possession of the funds, but he will be able to move the funds of any users without permission._

```
if (isTrusted[_recipient]) {
```
